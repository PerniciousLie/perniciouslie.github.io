			<dt>Intial Monetary Cost</dt>
				<dd>Solar Updraft Towers (SUT) are incredibly expensive to build. A 1-kilometer (.62-mile) tall chimney 
				made from cement and steel, and a collector 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in diameter would cost $1.67 billion. 
				That price tag is enough to put off potential investors for an industrial-sized plant based on technology 
				that has not been tested that much. SUTs are much less efficient than photo-voltaic cells (PV) with 1-2% of 
				the energy being converted into usable power, compared to PV's efficiency of 8-15%.
					</dd>
				<dd>The full cost of the tower is dependant on the location on which it will be built. Since it requires a 
				vast amount of land, purchasing and clearing the land is about 25-33% of the incurred cost of the project. 
				Apollo Development hopes to build 3 towers in West Texas with 2,400-foot towers, each costing between $700 
				million to $800 million.
					</dd>
			<dt>Economical Impact</dt>
				<dd>The initial cost is much more than a regular solar array tower, but the efficiency is not affected by 
				dust and debris like solar panels are. The power production can last 24 hours if the thermal sinks can store 
				enough heat during the day (which will be no problem if the SUT is built in a desert). Building the tower is 
				no small feat, because of the amount of funding required, but the canopy can be used as a greenhouse to provide 
				food to the surrounding region.

			<dt>Environmental Impact</dt>
				<dd>There are many other applications for the Solar Updraft Tower:
					<ul>
						<li>Release of humid ground-level air from an atmospheric vortex or solar chimney at altitude could 
						form clouds or precipitation, potentially altering local hydrology. Local de-desertification, or 
						afforestation could be achieved if a regional water cycle were established and sustained in an otherwise 
						arid area.</li>
						<li>The solar cyclone distiller could extract atmospheric water by condensation in the updraft of the 
						chimney. This solar cyclonic water distiller with a solar collector pond could adapt the solar 
						collector-chimney system for large-scale desalination of collected brine, brackish- or waste-water pooled 
						in the collector base.</li>
						<li>Fitted with a vortex chimney scrubber, the updraft could be cleaned of particulate air pollution. An 
						experimental tower is cleaning the air in China with little external energy input. Alternately, particulate 
						air pollution caught in the updraft could serve as a nucleation stimulus for precipitation either in the 
						chimney, or at release altitude as cloud seeds.</li>
