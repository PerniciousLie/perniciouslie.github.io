			<dt>The Chimney Effect</dt>
				<dd>Solar updraft towers use a phenomenon known as the chimney effect (stack effect). 
					The chimney effect is the movement of air into and out of buildings, chimneys, or flue gas 
					stacks and is driven by buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor 
					air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. The result is either a positive 
					or negative buoyancy force. The greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure, 
					the greater the buoyancy force.<br><br>
					
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hot air the greenhouse surrounding the tower collects travels towards 
					it at increasing speed because of the slope of the polycarbonate panes. This airflow drives wind turbines, placed in 
					the chimney or around the chimney base, to produce electricity.
					<br><br>The image to the right shows the general concept of how a SUT works.

							showing the general concept of how a SUT works.</div><br></dd>
			<dt>Storage of Solar Energy</dt>
				<dd>Adding saltwater ponds and transpired collectors would increase the energy production of the tower to an efficiency
					between 60 to 80%, which is about 2 to 3 times more effective than a traditional greenhouse. Transpired collectors use 
					solar energy to preheat ventilation (outdoor) air as it is drawn into a building. The technology is ideally suited for
					buildings with at least moderate ventilation requirements in sunny locations with long heating seasons. Since SUTs are 
					always under sunlight, the heating of the air is only reliant on the hours of daylight provided by the sun.<br><br>
					
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The average depth of the plenum between the transpired collector and the plantâ€™s structural wall is 6 inches. The 
					canopy at the top of the wall acts as both a manifold for the airflow and a solar heat collection device. The canopy face 
					is made of perforated plate with 1% porosity. <a href="images/transpired-collector.gif">Click here</a> to see a diagram
					of a transpired solar collector.<br><br>
					
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The use of thermal retention ponds increases the time the plant can produce energy by reducing the diurnal variation 
					(fancy term that means the variation between a high temperature and a low temperature that occurs during the same day) 
					by using the heat stored in the ponds to continue to heat the air towards the turbines in the tower. The reason why water
					is the best heat sink is because it has a much higher heat capacity than any other naturally occuring substance on earth.
					Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquid. Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a 
					substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one calorie, or 
					4.184 Joules.<br><br></dd>
